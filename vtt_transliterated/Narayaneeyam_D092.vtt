Understanding that the rituals described in the Vedas are beyond their seeming results-oriented nature, I shall dedicate all such rituals that I perform, to Thee O Lord! And become free from the bondage of action. May I not, even by mistake, by thought deed or speech attempt to do what is forbidden by the Vedas. If any such action becomes unavoidable, that too I will dedicate to Thee alone, O The Glowing Light of Consciousness!

O Lord! devotedly performing Thy worship, I will seek Thy grace.

Women and people of the lower social order are unprivileged to hear the narrations of Thy deeds and excellences and for chanting Thy names. They are indeed to be pitied. But I bemoan the unpeaceful lot of people of the higher castes, who in spite of having all the facilities of worshipping Thee, would not do so being arrogant of their learning and high birth. In Thy teachings they have been repeatedly instructed about Thee, they perform Yagyaas as a livelihood and for material ends, and there is no misdeed that they do not do. O Lord! I pray, do not make me one like them.

Those worldly undevoted people laugh loudly at the wise people who are devoted to Thee with their minds absorbed in Thee. They speak spitefully of them with statements like -'This is a wicked fellow and keeps saying Krishna and Raama to conceal his misconduct. Because of this person's shameless prattles, I could not say many important things. My brother is an hypocrite and feigns to worship Vishnu all the time.' O Lord! Do not make me like them.

O Slayer of Mura! That this Kali Yuga may be victorious, wherein by chanting Thy various names and glories alone Thy grace is achieved effortlessly and in no time. O Fulfiller of All Desires! Those born in Treta Krita Dwaapara also desire to be born indeed in Kali Kaala. Fortunately, those of us who are born now, in Kali, may we not O Lord! be deprived of Thy grace, because of the pursuit of poisonous sensuous sense enjoyments.

In the Kali Yuga devotees will abound, mostly in the Dravid land, i.e., South India. In the regions of the rivers Kaaveri, Taamraparni and the Kritamaalaa, the holy west, the devotees will be more. Oh Lord! I too am born in this region only, and have some devotion to Thee. O God! I pray, do not delude me by binding me with ropes of desire, and do make my devotion to Thee complete.

śikṣaya-enam	do punish him
Once king Pareekshit saw the merciless Kali who is the enemy of Dharma (righteousness), and to kill him, he drew his sword also. But he did not kill Kali, because Kali is a knower of the essence of Truth, and also because it has some good features. In Kali, Thy worship bears results very soon where as evil deeds take time to bring fruits. Kali is also afraid of Thy devotees, so he tries to take them away by disease etc., even before their devotion becomes firm. For this O Lord! punish him.

O Lord of the Universe! Who so ever, whole heartedly takes refuge in Thee, abandoning all actions, is no longer a debtor to the gods or sages, Pitris (or Manes), or a servant to them. Even if he has done any misdeeds, they are destroyed by Thee who do reside in his heart. O Lord of Guruvaayur! my sufferings, born of my sins, do remove and generate devotion in me.
