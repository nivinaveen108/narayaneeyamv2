ādau hairaṇyagarbhīṃ tanum-	in the beginning as Hiranyagarbha form
avikala-jīvātmikām-	undivided (collective) state of all jivas
āsthita:-tvaṃ	manifested Thou
jīvatvaṃ prāpya	becoming (separate) jivas
māyā-guṇa-gaṇa-khacita:	with Maayaa and its various Gunas associated
vartase viśvayone	(Thou do) manifest, O Thou Origin of All!
tatra-udvṛddhena sattvena	there, by well developed Sattva Guna
tu guṇa-yugalaṃ	indeed the other two (Rajas and Tamas)
bhakti-bhāvaṃ gatena	when devotion attitude is got
chitvā sattvaṃ ca hitvā	destroying (the other two) and Sattva also leaving behind
puna:-anupahita:	again unobstructed
vartitāhe tvam-eva	shall remain Thyself only
O Thou! The Origin of All! In the beginning Thou were in an undivided state of all jivas in the Hiranyagarbha form. Then Thou do manifest Thyself in multiplicity of jivas, and become associated with Maayaa and its various Gunas. With the well developed and dominant Sattva, devotional attitude is reached, by which the other two gunas Rajas and Tamas are destroyed. By and by when Sattva also is abandoned I (the jiva) shall, again, unobstructed, realise myself as Thyself only.

sattva-unmeṣāt	when Sattva upsurges (predominates)
kadācit khalu	sometimes indeed
viṣaya-rase	in sense enjoyments
doṣa-bodhe-api	harmfulness is realised even
bhūman	O Infinite Being!

proddhate durnivārā	attraction is difficult to overcome
cittaṃ tāvat-guṇā:-ca	then the mind and the gunas
grathitam-iha mitha:-	interlocked here mutually
tāni sarvāṇi roddhuṃ	all these to control
turye tvayi-eka-bhakti:-	in the Turiya Thee alone devotion
śaraṇam-iti	is the refuge, thus
bhavān haṃsa-rūpī nyagādīt	Thou, in the form of a swan instructed
O Infinite Being! When the Sattva Guna predominates, the harmfulness of sense enjoyments is realised. Whereas when the Rajas and Tamas are predominant, to abstain from worldly enjoyments becomes difficult, because the mind and the gunas are mutually interlinked. To control all these, devotion in Thy Tureeya state alone is the only refuge. Thus, in the form of a swan Thou instructed.

santi śreyāṃsi bhūyāṃsi-api	there are for welfare many (paths) also
ruci-bhidayā karmiṇāṃ	suited to taste of people
nirmitāni kṣudra-ānandā:-	and are created trivial joy giving

kṛṣṇa tebhya: bhaveyu:	O Krishna! From them can be had
tvaṃ ca-ācakhyathā sakhye	and Thou did say to Thy friend
nanu mahitatamāṃ	indeed super glorious
śreyasāṃ bhaktim-ekāṃ	and welfare bringing devotion alone
tvat-bhakti-ānanda-tulya:	Thy devotion's bliss in comparison
khalu viṣaya-juṣāṃ sammada:	for people engrossed in worldly pleasures
kena vā syat	by what can there be
There are many paths of welfare laid down to suit varying tastes of people as means of fulfilment. O Krishna! They lead to goals that yield only temporary and trivial pleasures. Thou did describe to Thy friend, Uddhava, devotion as the most glorious path for attainment of supreme spiritual welfare of man. Where does the joy that people get by worldly pursuits, stand in comparison to the bliss of devotion to Thee!

salila-kuharagasya-eva	in the waters' depths going (creatures) (living)
toya-ekamayya:	water is everywhere
sa:-ayaṃ khalu-	that this (person) indeed,

yoga-siddhī:-ca hṛdyā:	or Yogic powers attractive
na-ākāṅkṣati-	does not covet for
etat-āstāṃ	may this be so
svayam-anupatite	by itself coming (to him)
mokṣa-saukhye-api-anīha:	the liberation bliss also is not desired for
A person whose mind is satisfied in Thy devotion, moves about happily in this world. One who has dropped all desires, for him, every place is full of joy, just like an aquatic creature living in deep waters, finds water everywhere. Such a person does not covet Indraloka or Brahmaa's residence or the attractive Yogic powers. This may be so. The bliss of liberation coming of its own to him is also without his seeking.

puna:-api khalu	again also indeed
tai:-durbalai:-na-abhijayya:	by them, the weak senses are not conquered
saptārci:-dīpitārci:-dahati	the fire well lit burns down
kila yathā bhūri-dāru-prapañcam	indeed, just as, a great heap of wood
tvat-bhakti-oghe tathā-eva	in Thy devotion's stream in the same manner
pradahati duritaṃ	burns up sins (and sinful tendencies)
durmada: kva-indriyāṇām	the false power, of senses, where (does it stand)
If Thy devotee is sometimes ensnared by sense pleasure, because of his senses not being in his control fully, they by nature weak, cannot stand the onslaught of devotion and so Thy devotee cannot be conquered by the senses. Just as a well lit blazing fire burns down stacks and heaps of wood, in the same way Thy devotion burns away stacks of sins and sinful tendencies. When this happens, the false power of the senses do not stand any chance.

abhyastayā tarkakoṭyā	by the study of highly sophisticated arguments
Unless the heart melts with love, the hair of the whole body stand on end or tears of joy flow, how can the mind be purified. Of what use are austerities or learning devoid of devotion. Just as, by constant use of collyrium  the eyes can see the objects, the mind intuits Thy subtle truth by constant imbibing of Thy narrations and so purifying the soul. It is not so indeed by the study of highly sophisticated arguments.

To practice meditation, I will sit erect in a comfortable pose (sukhaasana) and gaze on the tip of the nose. Controlling my vital breath energies by doing Pooraka etc., praanaayaam (breath control) I will imagine the downward lotus in the heart as facing upward. I will imagine the sun, moon and fire above it and Thee in a delicate dark blue form as the water bearing clouds, seated on the top.

I meditate on Thy blue form which has lustrous hair, shining fish shaped earrings, a gentle smile with compassion flowing, lustre of Kaustubha spreading over the garlands and the big pearl necklaces, the Shreevatsa mark, a soft and charming abdomen, golden hued garment, comely well shaped thighs and lotus like tender feet.

O Beloved Lord! Again and again I will concentrate with growing eagerness on all Thy limbs. Then I will fix my mind on Thy lotus like face with a gentle smile. The fully absorbed mind in the Eternal Bliss Consciousness in a non-dual form will not think of anything else. Thus I shall remain steady in the advanced state of communion, by repeated effort.
