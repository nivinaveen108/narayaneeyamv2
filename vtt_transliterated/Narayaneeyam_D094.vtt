śuddhā: niṣkāma-dharmai:	purified minded people, by their desireless actions
pravara-guru-girā	by competent teacher's instructions
tat-svarūpaṃ paraṃ te	that aspect supreme of Thine
śuddhaṃ deha-indriya-ādi-	immaculate, from body sense etc.,
vyapagatam-	transcending
akhila-vyāptam-āvedayante	and all pervading , come to understand
nānātva-sthaulya-kārśya-ādi	multiplicity, big thin etc.,
tu guṇaja-vapu:-saṅgata:-	indeed are the Gunas in which the bodies are associated
adhyāsitaṃ te	are super imposed on Thee
vahne:-dāru-prabhedeṣu-iva	in fire, due to the wood of different form, just as,
mahat-aṇutā-dīptatā-	bigness, smallness brightness
śāntatā-ādi	dimness etc.,
People, whose minds are purified by performing desireless actions, come to understand from the instructions of competent teachers, Thy supreme aspect which is immaculate, bodiless, taintless, all pervading and transcendent. As for the qualities of multiplicity, stoutness, thinness etc., which are in association with the bodies constituted of the three gunas, are super imposed on Thee. It is like the expensiveness, small ness, dimness and brilliance of fire according to the nature of the fuel (wood) on which it manifests.

ācārya-ākhya-	teacher's teachings
adharastha-araṇi-	are the lower fire stick
samanumilat-śiṣya-rūpa-	coming in a disciple form
uttara-araṇi-	is the upper fire stick
āvedha:-udbhāsitena	striking (which) is lit (glows)
sphuṭatara-paribodha-	perfectly clear knowledge
agninā dahyamāne	fire, by which is burnt
karmālī-vāsanā-	the many action's desires (tendencies)
tat-kṛta-tanu-	by which is generated, with the
bhuvana-bhrānti-	body identification misconception
kāntāra-pūre	such a forest full (is burnt)
dāhya-abhāvena	then with a lack of burning material
vidyā-śikhini ca virate	when the knowledge generated fire also subsides
tvat-mayī khalu-avasthā	in Thee the total merger state alone (is there)
The fire of knowledge is ignited by the striking of two fire sticks, the lower one represents the teachings of the teacher, and the upper one the disciple (who comes seeking the knowledge). This fire illuminates perfectly clear knowledge and burns the forest full of many tendencies and desires which are an effect of past actions, and also the ignorance of identification with the body and the world. When such a forest is burnt up, the fire (of knowledge) for want of fuel also subsides (in Thee). Then the state of total merger in Thee alone remains.

api nigama-pathā:-	also are the Vedic paths
tat-phalāni-api-avāptā	their results even if achieved
mattā:-tvāṃ vismaranta:	(becoming) arrogant, Thee, they forget
prasajati patane	proceeding into downfall
yānti-anantān viṣādān	undergo endless sufferings
Other than the attainment of Thee, certainly, the other means of eradicating sufferings, which are resorted to, like cultivation, medicine, the six gunas, the six steps of Yoga etc., are ultimately ineffective in completely removing or the recurrence of all sufferings. The Vedic paths are difficult to pursue with their many inherent difficulties. Even if they are somehow pursued and their results obtained, by some, they in arrogance forget Thee, (who are the ultimate aim) and are led into downfall and undergo endless sufferings.

O Lotus Naval One! Where is there another fearless world other than Thy world the Vaikunthaloka? Residing in Satyaloka also, at the end of two Paraardhaas, Brahmaa is afraid of Thee (as Time) and does not live in peace. That being so, what to say of human beings who keep accumulating sins by unrighteous means! O Bestower of Boons! O friend of the Lowly! O Ocean full of mercy! therefore, do cut off my bondage.

O Lord! In reality, for me, who is merged in Thyselfness only, there is no bondage or liberation. Thy two aspects of Maayaa and knowledge manifest, indeed, like dreaming and awakening. The difference between the two, the bonded and the one who has achieved liberation while living, is that, the former, perched on the tree of the body has to eat the fruits of the sense experiences, while the latter does not have to do so and so is a non suffering soul.

Of what use are the words about the state of liberation in the embodied soul? This concept is far fetched for the impure minded. There is no way other than devotion for the mind to be even a bit purified. O Lord Vishnu! Do bring about that for me which by intense devotion, with surrendering of all fruits of action to Thee, and with Thy realisation by the teachings from a Guru, I may achieve oneness with Thee.

tāṃ na vācaṃ bhriyāsam	that scripture I will not study
In this world there are people who are totally engrossed in the study of Vedas and other scriptures and do not care to know Thee. It is a futile effort on their part just as owning a cow which has not calved. I will not study the scriptures wherein Thy form saturated with Pure Consciousness, and the world enchanting, all purifying and sportive incarnations are not spoken of.

Thy worship alone I will always dutifully perform. May it thus happen to me that I get to see Thy images and touch the feet of the groups of people who are lovingly attached to Thy feet. May I also worship Thee, sing Thy hymns, prostate to Thee, and lovingly recite Thy excellences and deeds.

The state of supreme blissful union with Thee is difficult to be attained by charity, sacrifice, vows, disciplines, austerities or by following the methods of Saankhya Yoga. The most meritorious Gopikaas attained intense bliss only by attachment to Thee. There are many devotees of Thine, but the loving devotion of the Gopikaas, to Thee, is highly esteemed by Thee. May that devotion strengthen in me. O Lord Krishna! O Lord of Guruvaayur! remove my sufferings.
