bandhu-snehaṃ vijahyāṃ	to (my) relatives affection (I will) give up
tava hi karuṇayā	by Thy grace alone
tvayi-upāveśita-ātmā	in Thee merged my mind
sarvaṃ tyaktvā careyaṃ	abandoning everything will wander about
sakalam-api jagat-vīkṣya	the whole world looking upon as only
māyā-vilāsam	Maayaa's expression
nānātvāt-bhrāntijanyāt	multiplicity due to false comprehension
sati khalu guṇa-doṣa-	so being, indeed, good and bad
avabodhe vidhi:-vā	its understanding or the does-
vyāsedha: vā kathaṃ tau	and don'ts, how come they both
tvayi nihita-mate:-	into Thee (whose) absorbed is the mind
vīta-vaiṣamya-buddhe:	and transcended the consciousness of differences
Thy grace alone will enable me to abandon my love and affection towards my relatives. With my mind merged in Thee, renouncing everything, I will wander about looking upon the whole world as an expression of Maayaa. The injunctions and prohibitions of the scriptures apply to the one who entertains the concepts of good or bad due to multiplicity caused by false comprehension. How can both of these apply to a person whose mind is absorbed in Thee and who has transcended the consciousness of differences.

kṣut-tṛṣṇā-lopa-mātre	hunger and thirst appeasing merely

tāpa-ucchitte:-upāyaṃ	is sorrows alleviating means
smarati sa hi suhṛt	(those who) think so, he alone is friend
sva-ātma-vairī tata:-anya:	one self's enemy (is) the other one
There are countless beings who are always absorbed in satisfying their hunger and thirst. Among them, a man is superior for being endowed with a discriminative mind. Human birth indeed is rare. Among men also a person may be one's own friend or a foe. A person whose mind is absorbed in Thee, is always concerned in the means of alleviating sorrow, is ones own friend. All others are their own foes.

tvat-prasādāt	by Thy grace
May I be clean pure and sweet like the water. May I be not blemished by taking food of any type, just as fire though all consuming, is unaffected by the defects of any substance. Just as there is fire in every tree, let me recognize me in all beings. The growth and decay is of the body, like waxing and waning of the moon, and not of Aatman, the self. By Thy grace, may I realise, the oneness of all individual bodies, just like the reflected images of the sun in universal waters.

May I not be like the pigeon who for the love of its off springs was killed by the hunter, along with them. Like the python may I eat whatever is available and also endure hunger when nothing is available. Let me be deep and serene like the ocean. Let me not fall a prey to the lust of women like a moth to fire. O Lord! let me seek the essence of things like the honey bee and unlike it let me not perish in accumulating wealth.

Let me not be led to captivity by women as an elephant is by a female. Let me not earn wealth in plenty because it is taken away by others, like the honey gatherers. Let me not be attracted into a snare by sweet words, as a deer is by vulgar music. May I not be too attached to food like a fish is to a bait. Like Pingalaa may I sleep soundly without a care. O Lord! May I not be killed by others like the Kurara bird for having to guard the meat it was carrying.

Devoid of sense of honour and dishonour, I will live very happily like a child, unaccompanied and all alone, like a solitary bangle on a maiden's wrist, I will move about restricting myself from all other noises of contacts and conflicts. May my mind be absorbed in Thee and not know anything beyond that, like the arrow maker who does not know the announcement of the king's coming. May I live in houses made by others, and so be not attached to any house, like the snake who lives in the holes made by rats.

ayaṃ viśeṣāt	this (body) specially (particularly)
The spider is a teacher in the sense, that, I learnt from it that the Universe created by Thee, is absorbed into Thee, by Thee alone. From the beetle I got the firm lesson that meditating on Thee confers Thy form. On careful thought I realised that though this body is a storehouse of filth and ashes, it is a great teacher, specially this body of mine. Because of it suffering from many diseases, I have been endowed with discrimination and renunciation.

Alas! Rid me of my infatuation to my body. O Lord of Guruvaayur! Because of love for it one is helplessly attached to house, wealth, wife etc., and so we forget Thy lotus feet. In the end this body is fit only for fire or dogs. Even now, while living, it is dragged hither and thither by senses of sight hearing touch taste etc. There is none alas to take us to Thy lotus feet.

O Lotus Eyed Lord! If obsession to body sense is unavoidable, do rid me of all my ailments and endow me with unshakable firm devotion to Thy lotus feet. This Braahmin body, which may take me to liberation, is achieved after many lives. O do not plunge it into lowly sensuous pleasures. O Lord of Guruvaayur! deign to save me.
