śrī kṛṣṇa	O Lord Krishna!
tvat-pada-upāsanam-	Thy feets worship

baddha-mithyā-artha-dṛṣṭe:-	(for those) bound by false material things looking for

api-āvṛta-ākṣa:	even (with) eyes closed
skhalati na kuhacit-	slips not at all
deva-deva-akhilātman	O Lord of Lords! O Soul of All Beings!
O Lord Krishna! I believe that the worship of Thy feet is the most fear expelling and the only refuge for those mortals who are suffering because of being deeply bound by the false material notions and wrong acceptance of ephemeral values as true. By devotion to Thee all fear is expelled, in every way, the methods of which are taught by Thee (in Bhagvad Geeta etc.). O Lord of Lords! O Soul of all Beings! A person who is steady in Thy devotion will not slip or falter even a wee bit even if he runs on the path of delusion with his eyes closed.

O Supreme Being! All the actions of my body speech and mind which are prompted by Thy power, I offer and dedicate to Thee, the Supreme Spirit who are here in the form of Lord Guruvaayur. A person may be of lowly caste, but if he has resigned his mind speech senses and vital energies at Thy feet, he sanctifies the worlds. It is not so even if a person is a Braahmin and is indifferent minded towards Thee.

bhīti:-nāma	fear indeed
dvitīyāt-bhavati nanu	from a second (entity) arises definitely
mana:- kalpitam ca dvitīyaṃ	and mind's projection is this second
tena-aikya-abhyāsa-śīla:	therefore, on oneness practicing

buddhyā nirundhyām	and intelligence will control
māyā-viddhe tu	by Maaya's infliction indeed
tasmin puna:-api	in the intellect again also
na tathā bhāti	does not shine (as before)
māyā-adhināthaṃ taṃ tvām	Maaya's Master, therefore, Thee
bhaktyā mahatyā	with great Bhakti
satatam-anubhajan-īśa	constantly worshipping O Lord!
bhītiṃ vijahyām	fear (I) will overcome
The feeling of fear arises from the consciousness of a second entity-different from oneself. This consciousness of a second entity is a projection of the mind. I will try to control my mind with effort and discriminative intelligence. But when this discriminative intelligence is overpowered and inflicted by Maaya, the consciousness of oneness does not reveal itself again. Therefore, O Lord! by constantly worshipping Thee with great Bhakti, I will overcome all fear.

tvat-māhātmya-prakārai:-	Thy glories when narrated
bhavati ca sudṛḍhā	it (devotion) becomes more firm
bhakti:-uddhūta-pāpā	Bhakti which effaces all sins
Bhakti, devotion, is generated in people with meritorious deeds and it grows by association with people who are always worshipping at Thy feet. Just as in this world, wealth and prosperity are generated by association with prosperous people. O Lord! May I always have such association, because intense and firm devotion, which effaces all sins, arises as a result of listening to Thy glories and narrations of Thy sportive activities which are sung by such devotees.

loka-bāhya:-careyam	(so that) I may move out of the world
Among the many paths of liberation, the path of devotion is the most preferred. Treading this path I shall fervently sing Thy glories and Thy deeds in Thy various incarnations, and also chant Thy grace conferring names. I may burst into laughter or cry suddenly, or at times roar or sing and dance about like a mad man. O Thou! bestow Thy compassion so that going on the path of Bhakti I may move about at will and not have to follow the world and its social norms.

I shall salute the five elements, everything comprising of the elements, fishes, birds, animals and other mortals, friends and enemies with the knowledge that they are all Thy forms alone. Thus with my mind balanced with Bhakti I will always be in Thy service and worship Thee. With Thy grace then I will achieve firm devotion, dispassion and the knowledge of the Truth in Reality, simultaneously and will not have to make an effort to achieve each one separately. (Just as swallowing a morsel of food gives the satisfaction of enjoyment, strength and appeasing of hunger).

I shall move about peacefully with my mind being cooled in the cool light of the moon of Thy toe-nails.

People who worship Thee in such a manner, also, without delay attain the highest pinnacle of divine love.

May that Maayaa not overpower me. O All pervading Being! the enlightened Yogi Prabuddha has said that this Thy Maayaa can be overcome only by devotion at Thy feet.
