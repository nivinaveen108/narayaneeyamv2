guṇa-sāmya-ruddha-vikṛtau	whose modifications were neutralised by the equipoise of the three Gunaas
tvayi āgatāyāṃ layam	and had become latent in Thee,
no mṛtyu: ca	neither death
tadā-amṛtaṃ ca	and then nor liberation
samabhūta-	(did) exist
na-ahna:	neither day

sthiti:	was in existence
tatra-eka: - tvam-	then Thou as the Only One (without another)
aśiṣyathā: kila	did remain, certainly
parānanda-prakāśa-ātmanā	as Supreme Bliss Consciousness
This world consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest worlds (gross and the subtle) did not exist at all, before and during the total dissolution.The three Gunaas (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas) of Maya were in equilibrium, preventing any modification and so had become latent in Thee. At that time neither death nor liberation existed. Day and night also did not exist. Thou alone remained at that time as the Supreme Bliss Consciousness.

no cet kiṃ	otherwise how
gagana-prasūna-sadṛśāṃ	like the sky flower
bhūya: bhavet-saṃbhava:	is manifestation again possible (in the new creative cycle)
O All pervading Lord! Then, Time, Karmas (effects of good and bad actions), Gunas (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas), all the Jivas and the entire universe (born out of Maayaa) were all merged in Thee and Thou were absorbed in Thy own nature of pure Consciousness Bliss. However, O Lord! the Srutis do not declare them as being non existent. They remained in causal form. Otherwise, like the non existence of the flowers in the sky, how could they come into existence again.

evaṃ ca	and in this manner
dvi-parārdha-kāla-vigatau-	the period of two Parardhas having ended
īkṣāṃ sisṛkṣātmikāṃ	(when) the glance with the will to create
bibhrāṇe tvayi	was cast by Thee
cukṣubhe	got activated
tribhuvanī-bhāvāya	for the creation of the three worlds
māyā svayam	Maayaa (bestirred) herself
māyāta: khalu	from Maayaa indeed
kāla-śakti: -	the power known as Time,
akhila-adṛṣṭaṃ	all that is latent (the effects of the deeds of the Jivas)
svabhāva: -api ca	and the resulting tendencies (innate nature)
prādurbhūya	emerging
guṇān-vikāsya	activating the three Gunaas
vidadhu: -	acted (so as to)
tasyā: -sahāyakriyām	support her (Maayaa's) work
Thus when a period of two Paraardhaas ended, Thou cast Thy glance, which was with the will to create the three worlds. Then Maayaa (Thy creative power) got activated and from it emerged the power of time, the impressions of karma and the resulting tendencies. These supported Maayaa by disturbing the balance of the three Gunaas and diversified as the manifested universe.

O Lord! Thou has Maayaa by Thy side, but are not influenced by it. The scriptures declare Thee as mere witness. Thy appearances in the diverse forms of Maayaa are mere reflections called Jivas which are not different from Thee. Maayaa being aroused by time and prompted by Thee, projected the principle of Intelligence, which is called Mahat.

sampuṣṭaṃ triguṇai: -	though having all the three Gunaas in full measure
tama: - atibahulaṃ	being dominated by Tamas
viṣṇo	O All pervading Lord
bhavat preraṇāt	by Thy prompting
O All pervading Lord! Even though this Mahat Tatwa is made up of three Gunaas, it is predominated by Satwa. Hence it recognizes the collective Jivas as macro "I". (As cosmic whole and not as individual entities). But the same Mahat Tatwa, when predominated by Tamas and Rajas, creates by Thy will the feeling of individual "I" called Aham Tatwa.

vidhu-vidhi-śrīrudra-śārīrakān	the Moon, Brahma, Sri Rudra, Kshetrajna (presiding over the Antahkarana)
This Aham Tatwa (Ahamkaara) further categorized itself,based on the three Gunaas as Vaikarika (Satwa), Tejas (Rajas) and Tamas (Tamas).From Satwa were created the presiding deities of : Gyanendriyaas -(organs of knowledge) which are Dik Devata (of hearing), Vaayu (of touch), Soorya (of seeing), Varuna (of taste) and Ashwini Devatas (of smell). Karmendriyaas - (organs of action) which are Agni (of speech), Indra (of hands), Vishnu (of the legs), Mitra (of excretion) and Prajaapati (of reproduction).

From the Raajasic aspect of the Ahankaara the ten Indriyaas were born (5 Karmendriyaas and 5 Jnanendriyaas). O Lord! by Thy will, from the Taamasic aspect of the Ahankaara was born, the sound (Sabda) which is the subtle essence (Tanmaatra) of space (Aakaash).
