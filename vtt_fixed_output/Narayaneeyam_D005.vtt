व्यक्त-अव्यक्तम्-इदं	this (universe) made up of the gross and the subtle (manifested and unmanifested)
न किञ्चित्-अभवत्-	nothing existed
प्राक्-प्राकृत-प्रक्षये	before Praakrita Pralaya
मायायाम्	(when) Maayaa (Thy cosmic creative power)
गुण-साम्य-रुद्ध-विकृतौ	whose modifications were neutralised by the equipoise of the three Gunaas
त्वयि आगतायां लयम्	and had become latent in Thee,
नो मृत्यु: च	neither death
तदा-अमृतं च	and then nor liberation
समभूत-	(did) exist
न-अह्न:	neither day
न रात्रे:	or night
स्थिति:	was in existence
तत्र-एक: - त्वम्-	then Thou as the Only One (without another)
अशिष्यथा: किल	did remain, certainly
परानन्द-प्रकाश-आत्मना	as Supreme Bliss Consciousness
This world consisting of the manifest and the unmanifest worlds (gross and the subtle) did not exist at all, before and during the total dissolution.The three Gunaas (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas) of Maya were in equilibrium, preventing any modification and so had become latent in Thee. At that time neither death nor liberation existed. Day and night also did not exist. Thou alone remained at that time as the Supreme Bliss Consciousness.

काल: कर्म गुणाश्च जीवनिवहा विश्वं च कार्यं विभो

तेषां नैव वदन्त्यसत्त्वमयि भो: शक्त्यात्मना तिष्ठतां
नो चेत् किं गगनप्रसूनसदृशां भूयो भवेत्संभव: ॥२॥
काल:	Time
कर्म	Karma (effects of actions of Jivas)
गुणा: - च	and the three Gunas
जीवनिवहा:	and all the Jivas
विश्वं च कार्यं	and the universe which is an effect (of Maya)
विभो	O All pervading Lord!
चित्-लीलारतिम्-एयुषि त्वयि	in Thy own nature of pure Consciousness, were absorbed
तदा	at that time (of Maha Pralaya)
निर्लीनताम्-आययु:	and had become completely merged (in Thee)
तेषां न-एव वदन्ति-	of them (the Srutis) do not declare
असत्त्वम्-	absolute non existence
अयि भो:	O Lord!
शक्त्यात्मना तिष्ठतां	in the form of causal entities they remained
नो चेत् किं	otherwise how
गगन-प्रसून-सदृशां	like the sky flower
भूय: भवेत्-संभव:	is manifestation again possible (in the new creative cycle)
O All pervading Lord! Then, Time, Karmas (effects of good and bad actions), Gunas (Satwa, Rajas and Tamas), all the Jivas and the entire universe (born out of Maayaa) were all merged in Thee and Thou were absorbed in Thy own nature of pure Consciousness Bliss. However, O Lord! the Srutis do not declare them as being non existent. They remained in causal form. Otherwise, like the non existence of the flowers in the sky, how could they come into existence again.

एवं च द्विपरार्धकालविगतावीक्षां सिसृक्षात्मिकां
बिभ्राणे त्वयि चुक्षुभे त्रिभुवनीभावाय माया स्वयम् ।
मायात: खलु कालशक्तिरखिलादृष्टं स्वभावोऽपि च
प्रादुर्भूय गुणान्विकास्य विदधुस्तस्यास्सहायक्रियाम् ॥३॥
एवं च	and in this manner
द्वि-परार्ध-काल-विगतौ-	the period of two Parardhas having ended
ईक्षां सिसृक्षात्मिकां	(when) the glance with the will to create
बिभ्राणे त्वयि	was cast by Thee
चुक्षुभे	got activated
त्रिभुवनी-भावाय	for the creation of the three worlds
माया स्वयम्	Maayaa (bestirred) herself
मायात: खलु	from Maayaa indeed
काल-शक्ति: -	the power known as Time,
अखिल-अदृष्टं	all that is latent (the effects of the deeds of the Jivas)
स्वभाव: -अपि च	and the resulting tendencies (innate nature)
प्रादुर्भूय	emerging
गुणान्-विकास्य	activating the three Gunaas
विदधु: -	acted (so as to)
तस्या: -सहायक्रियाम्	support her (Maayaa's) work
Thus when a period of two Paraardhaas ended, Thou cast Thy glance, which was with the will to create the three worlds. Then Maayaa (Thy creative power) got activated and from it emerged the power of time, the impressions of karma and the resulting tendencies. These supported Maayaa by disturbing the balance of the three Gunaas and diversified as the manifested universe.

प्रतिबिंबत:	as reflections
विविशिवान् जीव: -अपि	Thou entered as individual soul also
न-एव-अपर:	(which) is not at all different from ( Thee)
काल-आदि-प्रतिबोधिता-	being aroused by Time etc.

बुद्धि-तत्त्वम्-असृजत्-	projected the principle of Intelligence
य: -असौ	which (buddhi tatva)
महान्-उच्यते	is called Mahat
O Lord! Thou has Maayaa by Thy side, but are not influenced by it. The scriptures declare Thee as mere witness. Thy appearances in the diverse forms of Maayaa are mere reflections called Jivas which are not different from Thee. Maayaa being aroused by time and prompted by Thee, projected the principle of Intelligence, which is called Mahat.

चक्रे - अस्मिन्	that which causes the awareness of
सविकल्प-बोधक-	separate individuality
महत्-तत्वं	Ahankaara (Ego)
महान् खलु-असौ	this same Mahat indeed
सम्पुष्टं त्रिगुणै: -	though having all the three Gunaas in full measure
तम: - अतिबहुलं	being dominated by Tamas
विष्णो	O All pervading Lord
भवत् प्रेरणात्	by Thy prompting
O All pervading Lord! Even though this Mahat Tatwa is made up of three Gunaas, it is predominated by Satwa. Hence it recognizes the collective Jivas as macro "I". (As cosmic whole and not as individual entities). But the same Mahat Tatwa, when predominated by Tamas and Rajas, creates by Thy will the feeling of individual "I" called Aham Tatwa.
